							With this app you can display a text with multiple phones. You can dynamically add or remove phones. Imaging a concert with many Pre owners which all stand together and display one text all over their phones.

							One phone is the master phone. The master creates a new channel with a password. With this combination he can set and change the text.<br><br>A new channel is created automatically when he sets a text of a channel which does not exist. Otherwise he will get a password error.<br><br>Every slave phone has to join this channel. Every new phone will display a part of the whole text. If one phone is removed the text is rearranged automatically. Just stand in order and display the text.<br><br>The master can change the text to display something new. Click the screen to leave a channel.<br><br>Now find some friends and display text together. I would be glad when you send me a photo with your phones displaying a text.
